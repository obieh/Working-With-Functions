# Working-With-Functions
**This project demonstrates how to use functions in shell script.**

## What Are Functions?

### A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. Instead of writing the same code multiple times, you define it once and call it whenever needed.

### Think of a function like a microwave preset button:
* You program it once (e.g., "Popcorn â€“ 2 minutes, high power").
* Later, you just press the button instead of setting time and power manually each time.
